# Threads - ICS4U PROJECT 2017

## Overview 
An e-commerce website made using Python and Django web framework.

Please note that this project was not created with order processing in mind and it will not be implemented. This is the reason we did not use Django-Oscar.

## Getting Started and Requirements
Before downloading this project, you must have Python 2.7 (2.7.11 was used in development) and Django web framework (1.11 was used in development) installed on your machine.

For a guide on how to install Django web framework, https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/install/

If you simply wish to run the server and be able to browse the webpage, you must download the package and direct your command line to the root folder (your_directory/Threads/website/). Once command line is in this directory, you may execute the command "manage.py runserver" which will initialize the server. Once everything is up and running, in your browser, visit "localhost:8000".
