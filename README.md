# Threads - ICS4U PROJECT 2017

## Overview 
An e-commerce website made using Python 2.7 and Django web framework for the purposes of learning web development.

Please note that this project was not created with order processing in mind and it will not be implemented. This is the reason we did not use Django-Oscar.

## Getting Started and Requirements
Before downloading this project, you must have Python 2.7 (2.7.11 was used in development) and Django web framework (1.11 was used in development) installed on your machine.

For a guide on how to install Django web framework, https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/install/

If you wish to run the server and be able to browse the webpage, you must download the package and direct your command line to the root folder (your_directory/Threads/website/). Once command line is in this directory, you may execute the command "manage.py runserver" which will initialize the server. Once everything is up and running, in your browser, visit "localhost:8000".

### This project includes a make-shift data seeder for testing how the site handles larger data under the directory "Threads/website/catalog/management/commands/dbseed.py"

## Additional Notes for Future Teams
Our team worked hard to learn Django in the short amount of time we had while still finishing all the features we originally set out to implement. Although we managed to finish and polish those key features, we left a few features like ratings, user shipping destinations and a properly implemented featured section unfinished due to time constraints. We wish you luck with your project and hope you can add even more cool stuff to the site! 

Bonus points if you can think of a better name than Cliffs.
